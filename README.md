## Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict diabetes using clinical health indicator data. The goal is to build models that can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on features such as BMI, glucose level, age, and physical activity. 

The project includes:
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Training multiple classification models
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Visualizing performance metrics

## Data Preprocessing & EDA

- Handled missing values and categorical variables
- Converted text to numeric using label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance
- Performed exploratory data analysis:
  - Target variable distribution
  - Feature correlation heatmap
  - Histograms and boxplots for key indicators

## Modeling

- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20
- **Vectorization:** Label encoding + One-hot for categorical features
- **Models Evaluated:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

- **Metrics Evaluated:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

---

## Results

- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 96%)
- **Insights:**
  - High glucose and HbA1c levels strongly correlate with diabetes.
  - Lifestyle factors like physical inactivity and smoking also contribute significantly.
  - SMOTE improved recall without overfitting.

---

## Conclusion

- Logistic Regression and SVM performed best overall.
- Data preprocessing and class balancing played a key role in boosting model performance.
- The project demonstrates the utility of machine learning in early diabetes detection and preventive healthcare analytics.
